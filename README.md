# Excel05-Adecco_HR_Analytics  

Adecco India, a mid-sized technology firm, has recently experienced rising employee attrition, particularly among junior-level employees in the sales department. The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive HR analytics study to identify key factors driving attrition and develop data-backed insights to support strategic retention efforts.

Using employee-level data containing demographic details, job-related attributes, compensation metrics, and satisfaction scores, this project applies both basic and intermediate analytical techniques using Excel. Key analyses include calculating the overall attrition rate, identifying departments with the highest turnover, measuring satisfaction levels across roles, and assessing demographic and compensation patterns among employees who leave.

The study further explores medium-level insights, such as determining the top factors correlated with attrition, analyzing how job involvement, marital status, stock options, and training impact turnover, and evaluating relationships between job satisfaction, performance ratings, work-life balance, and employee tenure.

Through PivotTables, scatter plots, correlation analysis, and calculated fields, the findings highlight critical drivers such as low job involvement, limited career growth, high business travel, low satisfaction levels, and overtime patterns. These insights help uncover department-specific issues and employee segments at higher risk of leaving.

Overall, the project enables Adecco India to develop targeted retention strategies, improve employee engagement, optimize career development programs, strengthen compensation policies, and ultimately reduce turnover. This HR analytics approach empowers the organization to build a more stable, motivated, and high-performing workforce.
